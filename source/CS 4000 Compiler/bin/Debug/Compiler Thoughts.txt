Compiler Thoughts: Code Counter = 71

-Done--- Runtime Error for 0 ^ -1

-Done--- With statement variables addressed out of scope.

-Done--- Fix the with statement. I'll have to add it in semantics.

-Done--- Add File handling to read and read line;

-Done--- Edit the semantic for assignment to assign for arrays.

-Done--- When accessing arrays, the indexed location should be
  added to the symbol table as a temporary and then
  pushed onto the SAS stack.

-Done--- Type of id must be Array if you're indexing it.

-Done--- Size of an array can't be 0.

-Done--- Reverse size in arrays. In Symbol Table.

-Done--- Instead of having to use a different stack for the 
  case statement I can just put a delimiter on the stack
  to say when to stop. Since the case will only worry about
  a Symbol Table index, then I can pick any negative 
  number to be my delimiter.

-Done--- In the data section, whenever a variable is
  declared, the semantic should mark it declared
  in the symbol table. And mark the size of an array

-Done--- For arrays, the size of an array could be stored as
  a list in the symbol table. To handle multiple deminsional
  arrays.

-Done--- Allocate temporary variable locations.

-Done--- Need to add a semantic check to read and write to make 
  sure they are only trying to write an integer or read to an 
  integer.

-Done--- The read and write arguments are being reversed due to 
  the SAS.
